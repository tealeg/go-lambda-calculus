* Taking Go to Church
** (No, not *that* kind of church..)
** (Don't worry, this will get less cryptic)
** ... a bit.

* A question that comes up a lot in Go
**  "Is Go an object oriented langauge?"

Lets get a quick vote on that?

** I'm not here to answer that question

** .. but the answer is, "not especially"

** Questions that come up less often are ...

*** "Is Go an untyped language?"

*** "Is go a functional programming language?"

What do you think?

** These don't seem like interesting questions.
*** Let's ask something more fundamental

** What is the minimum set of primitives you can do useful work with in Go?
This is rhetoric, don't answer it yet!
** What is the most powerful abstraction in Go?
.. more rhetoric... 
** How can we derive complex behaviour from simple primitives?
.. rhetoric, but a bit grander in scope.. 
** How is a self-aware "being" built from atoms?
 
[[./dramatic.jpg]]

** This talk won't cover that last one (much)

*  Why am I even thinking about this?

** I've got over 40 years programming behind me

** Now, I'm more interested in fundamentals

** What ideas you're exposed to tends to depend on:
- how and where you learned to program
- what languages you work with

* So let's explore!
* Things people in the Go world rarely talk about.
#+begin_quote
Y = λf.(λx.f (x x))(λx.f (x x))
#+end_quote

Who knows what this is?

* Lambda Calculus
** A formal system, in mathematical terms
** ... but essentially a programming language
** ... created before computers existed

* We're not going to go very deep
** We don't have much time, and it would *hurt*.

* OK.  Now to some Go:

** First a type

#+begin_src go
type λ func(l λ) λ
#+end_src

** We asked "Is Go an untyped language?"

No, but imagine a world where you only have this type!
#+begin_src go
type λ func(l λ) λ
#+end_src

* Checkpoint:
** Is everyone familiar with the notion of a closure?

#+BEGIN_SRC go
  func makeClosure() func() int {
          x := 4
          return func() int { return x }
  }

  a := makeClosure()
  a() // => 4
#+END_SRC

* Pop Quiz: 1
** Who's this?
[[./curry-photo.jpg]]

* Haskell Curry (1900-1982)
** What's named after him?
[[./curry-photo.jpg]]


* Yes, the programming language "Haskell"
** But also.. Currying
Even though he didn't invent it.

** Moses Schönfinkel (6 years earlier)
[[./schoenfinkel.jpg]]

** Gottlob Frege (1893)
[[./frege.jpg]]

* Currying
** an equivalency:

#+BEGIN_SRC go
x := f(a, b, c)
x := f(a)(b)(c)
#+END_SRC

We need to know that to understand the next piece

* Lambda Calculus syntax in our Go world
#+BEGIN_SRC
λa.a         => func(a λ) λ { return a }
λa.(λb.ba)   => func(a λ) λ { return func(b λ) λ { return b(a) }}
λab.ba       => func(a λ) λ { return func(b λ) λ { return b(a) }}
λab.(bb)(aa) => func(a λ) λ { return func(b λ) λ { return (b(b))(a(a)) }}
#+END_SRC



* .. and then a closure that is a bridge
#+BEGIN_SRC go

    func makeCounter() (λ, func(), func()) {
            var i int = 0

            inc := func(f λ) λ{
                    i = i + 1
                    return f	
            }

            get := func() int {
                    return i
            }

            reset := func() {
                    i = 0
            }

            return inc, get, reset
    }

#+END_SRC

Remember =inc= and =get!=
These functions returned by =makeCounter= are our bridge back to normal, typed Go.



* A curried function
** But what does it do?

#+BEGIN_SRC go
  // λ ab.b
  x := func(a λ) λ {
          return func(b λ) λ {
                  return b
          }
  }

#+END_SRC

* It's part of sequence, here's the next one

#+BEGIN_SRC go
  // λ ab.ab
  y := func(a λ) λ {
          return func(b λ) λ {
                  return a(b)
          }
  }
#+END_SRC
** ... and a third
#+BEGIN_SRC go
  // λ ab.aab
  z := func(a λ) λ {
          return func(b λ) λ {
                  return a(a(b))
          }
  }
#+END_SRC

* Let's see what happens when we pass our =inc= function to =x=

#+BEGIN_SRC go
  e := x(inc) // e = (λ ab.b)inc
#+END_SRC
We get a function back where any mention of =a= is replaced by =inc=.

#+BEGIN_SRC go
  e := func(b λ) λ {  // e = λ b.b
          return b
  }
#+END_SRC

If we then evaluate this:

#+BEGIN_SRC go
  _ = e(nil)       // (λ b.b)nil => nil
  result := get()  // inc is never called, so result = 0
#+END_SRC

... we get =0=

* What happens when we pass =inc= to =y=
#+BEGIN_SRC go
  e := y(inc)
#+END_SRC
We get a function back where any mention of =a= is replaced by =inc=.

#+BEGIN_SRC go
  e := func(z λ) λ {
          return inc(z)
  }
#+END_SRC

If we then evaluate this:

#+BEGIN_SRC go
  e(nil)
#+END_SRC

We'll call inc:
#+BEGIN_SRC go

  inc := func(f λ) λ {
           i = i + 1
           return f
  }
#+END_SRC

.. and then calling =get()= will return =1=
* What will happen if we do the same with function =z=?
Reminder: this is =z=
#+BEGIN_SRC go
  // λ ab.aab
  z := func(a λ) λ {
          return func(b λ) λ {
                  return a(a(b))
          }
  }
#+END_SRC


* That's right!
** We get a =2=

* Another way to represent numbers
#+BEGIN_SRC go
  // 0 = λ ab.b
  func zero(a λ) λ {
    return func(b λ) λ {
      return b
    }
  }

  func one(a λ) λ {
    return func(b λ) λ {
      return a(b)
    }
  }

 func two(a λ) λ {
    return func(b λ) λ {
      return a(a(b))
    }
  }          
#+END_SRC

* Church numerals
** We have to accept that these functions are numbers, even without using our =inc= and =get= functions.
** =inc= also demonstrates that these numbers can also be exponents:
#+BEGIN_SRC go
  n := two(two) // 2**2
  _ = n(inc)
  get() // => 4
  reset()        
  n = two(two)(two) // (2**2)**2  => 4**2
  _ = n(inc)
  get() // => 16
#+END_SRC
** It's a weird name...

* Pop Quiz 2: Who's this?
[[./alan-turing.jpg]]
* Alan Turing (1912-1954)
** Creater of the Turing Machine
[[./alan-turing.jpg]]
 - A theoretical, mechanical machine
 - Any algorithm can be implemented on a Turing Machine

* Pop Quiz 3: Who's this?
[[./Alonzo_Church.jpg]]

* Alonzo Church (1903-1995)
** PhD supervisor of Turing
** Invented the lambda calculus 
** Invented Church numerals
To make numbers work in the lambda calculus
** Church-Turing Thesis
[[./Alonzo_Church.jpg]]

* Operations on church numbers
** Succesor 
#+BEGIN_SRC go
  // λ abc.b(abc)
  succ = func(a λ) λ {
      return func(b λ) λ {
          return func(c λ) λ {
             return b(a(b)(c))
          }
       }
  }
#+END_SRC

* Successor to zero
#+BEGIN_SRC go

  // λ ab.b
  zero := func(x λ) λ { return func(y λ) λ { return y } }

  s0 := succ(zero)   // s0 = (λ abc.b(abc))(λ ab.b)
#+END_SRC

The result of =succ(zero)= is a function where all references to =a= are replaced with =zero=:
#+BEGIN_SRC go
  s0 := func(b λ) λ {
          return func(c λ) λ {
            return b(zero(b)(c))
        }
  }
#+END_SRC
* ... successor to zero
What will happen when we evaluate =zero(b)(c)= at the heart of this function?
#+BEGIN_SRC go
  zerothB := (func(x λ) λ { return func(y λ) λ {return y} })( b )( c )
  // parameter x is thrown away
  zerothB := func(y λ) λ { return y }(c)
  // So the evaluation resolves to:
  zerothB := c
#+END_SRC

so..

#+BEGIN_SRC go
  s0 := func(b λ) λ {
          return func(c λ) λ {
            return b(c)
        }
 }
#+END_SRC

What's interesting about this function?

* That's right!

#+BEGIN_SRC go
  one := func(a λ) λ {
          return func(b λ) λ {
            return a(b)
          }
  }
#+END_SRC
* Addition
** We get it for free!
#+BEGIN_SRC go
  plus := succ
  result := one(plus)(one)
  _ = result(inc)
  get() // => 2        
#+END_SRC

* Okay, soon it'll be time to rest your brain
The break is coming I promise.

* Some lambda forms algorithms to enjoy in your own time :-)
** Multiplication
#+BEGIN_SRC go
  // λabc.a(bc)
  func mul (a λ) λ {
    return func(b λ) λ {
      return func(c λ) λ {
        return a(b(c))
      }
    }
  }

  four := mul(two)(two)

#+END_SRC
* Boolean logic
#+BEGIN_SRC go
    // λab.a
    func True(a λ) λ {
            return func(b λ) λ {
                    return a
            }
    }

    // λab.b
    func False(a λ) λ {
            return func(b λ) λ {
                    return b
            }
    }

    // λab.a(b)
    func IfThenElse(a λ) λ {
            return func(b λ) λ {
                    return a(b)
            }
    }

  trueOne := IfThenElse(True)(one)(two)
  falseTwo := IfThenElse(False)(one)(two)
#+END_SRC

* Recursion
** The famous Y-combinator!
#+BEGIN_SRC
 Y = λf.(λx.f (x x))(λx.f (x x))
#+END_SRC

I've not implemented this one yet!  This implements recursion in any
language that supports first class functions.

* What's the point of all this?
* Originally, it answered questions about what was possible.
Turing added the part that made it seem feasible in the *real* world.
... though Conrad Zuse was already working on that :-) 
* Now, it gives us an important lesson:
- Any problem that can be solved in computing can be solved in Go, using only functions.
- Functions are the most powerful primitive we have.
- Technically we don't need types, or generics.  In practise they're easier to use.
* What about the notion of the self-aware system?
- This process is possibly isomorphic to how we build functionality in the lambda calculus.
- Read "Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal, Golden, Braid" by Douglas Hofstadter
