* Go Lambda Calculus

This repository captures the implementation of various aspects of
lambda calculus I used to support my presentation to the [[https://www.meetup.com/golang-users-berlin/events/288948507/][GDG Berlin Go
meetup on the 12th of October 2022]] and then again on [[https://www.meetup.com/hannover-gophers/events/297099701/][22nd of
November, 2023 for the Hannover Gophers]].

This code isn't yet complete, and I'll probably keep working on it,
from time to time. The presentation itself is contained in the
=presentation= subdirectory, and is in [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] format (I presented
using [[https://github.com/rlister/org-present][org-present]] for the Berlin event, and Org-reveal (reveal.js) for
the Hannover event).
